# RAK4631_Get_Addr

Small update to the [ble_uart.ino example](https://github.com/RAKWireless/WisBlock/blob/master/examples/RAK4630/communications/BLE/ble_uart/ble_uart.ino): it fetches the MAC address, prints it out on the Serial console, and sets the device's name to "nRF52 BLE xx xx xx xx xx xx".
